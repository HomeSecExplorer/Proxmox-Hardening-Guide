# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue in any guide, example, or automation in this repository, please help keep users safe.

## Supported scope

This project contains **documentation** and example snippets. There is no network-facing software here. Security reports typically cover:

- Incorrect hardening advice that reduces security
- Steps that may lead to data loss if followed verbatim
- Unsafe defaults in sample configurations

## Reporting a vulnerability

- **Preferred**: open a **Private disclosure** via GitHub Security Advisories (Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability), or
- If not available, open an **Issue** with minimal details and request to convert it to a private advisory.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not post full exploit details in public issues. Instead, request conversion to a private advisory.
